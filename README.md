### What is CrushPaper?
CrushPaper is for students, writers and anyone who writes papers, essays or articles and quotes their sources.

Easily research the web for relevant sources, save quotations from them to CrushPaper.com and then combine them with your own insights into a paper. 

### Why is CrushPaper Special?
CrushPaper makes it easy to organize your quotations and notes into hierarchies within notebooks.

CrushPaper's keyboard and mouse features make it easy to move your notes and quotations into whatever structure feels good to your brain. 

The CrushPaper Chrome extension makes it easy to save quotations by right clicking to save text you have selected.

You can use CrushPaper on your mobile device but much of its functionality only works in a web browser.
  
CrushPaper is free and open source under the GNU Affero General Public License. You can even run it on your own computer instead of using CrushPaper.com. It runs on Windows, Linux and probably OSX.
