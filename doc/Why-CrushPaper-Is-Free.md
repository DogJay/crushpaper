### As Cheesy as This Is

I believe that the world would be a better place if we were clearer thinkers.  

### Clearer Thinking

I believe that people think more clearly when they write down their thoughts and arrange their thoughts visually in a way that helps them make sense of those thoughts.  

### More Willing to Write

I believe that people are more willing to write when they can fully express their thoughts. I hope CrushPaper enables them to do so.
