### The Problem

I have been making lists for a long time just like you probably have.
<br><br>

I've tried different methods and have not been happy for long.
<br><br>

Paper feels great, but I either lose or smudge the paper, and I can't search it.
<br><br>

List making applications quickly push my notes to all of my devices but the applications don't seem powerful enough for more than shopping lists.
<br><br>

Research and clipping applications are usually very easy to use but are not as flexible as I want.
<br><br>

Some of the best applications are closed source and have had reports of security issues and losing information.
<br><br>   

### The Solution

I want to use an application that makes it easy to organize all of my notes and quotations in any hierarchical structure I want.
<br><br>

I want to use an application that makes it easy to move sets of my information around quickly with the keyboard or with the mouse.
<br><br>
   
I want to make CrushPaper that application.
