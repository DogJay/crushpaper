### What is CrushPaper?
CrushPaper is for students, writers and anyone who writes papers, essays or articles and quotes their sources.<br><br>

Easily research the web for relevant sources, save quotations from them to CrushPaper.com and then combine them with your own insights into a paper.<br><br> 

### Why is CrushPaper Special?
CrushPaper makes it easy to organize your quotations and notes into hierarchies within notebooks.<br><br>

CrushPaper's keyboard and mouse features make it easy to move your notes and quotations into whatever structure feels good to your brain.<br><br> 

The CrushPaper Chrome extension makes it easy to save quotations by right clicking to save text you have selected.<br><br>

You can use CrushPaper on your mobile device but much of its functionality only works in a web browser.<br><br>
  
CrushPaper is free and open source. You can even run it on your own computer instead of using CrushPaper.com. It runs on Windows, Linux and probably OSX.<br><br>

CrushPaper is made mostly by one person. That is me, Zap Blasterson. If you have any suggestions or complaints you can message me on Twitter, GitHub or Google Groups and I will do my very best to improve CrushPaper.
